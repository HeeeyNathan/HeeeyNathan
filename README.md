- 👋 Hi, I’m @HeeeyNathan
- 👀 I’m interested in integrating taxonomic, functional, and [phylo]genetic diversity through statistical and ecological explorations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to cope the overwhelming pressure of academia. Spoiler alert, its harder than it looks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on statistical and ecological explorations of taxonomic, functional, and [phylo]genetic diversity. Also in sharing data, skills, and possibly a beer (or three).
